✅ Got curious. ✅ He moved when others froze.
✅ Followed his own analysis. ✅ He trusted his process, not the market’s mood swings.
✅ Stayed grounded. ✅ He found hidden value through deep research.




Investors got it wrong: 
❌ Mistiming trades
❌ Paralyzed by fear
❌ Chasing hype


Most investors stay stuck in a cycle:
❌ Anxious they’ll screw it up and lose big.
❌ Overwhelmed by thousands of stocks.
❌ Frustrated by hours of research with no clear answers.

He bought great businesses, only when they were mispriced
Weschler didn’t just look for quality—he waited for the moment the market got it wrong.
✅  He sought out companies with high returns on capital, moats(competitive advantage), and consistent cash flows.
✅  But he never paid full price. A great business at a bad price is still a bad investment.
✅  He moved when everyone else was distracted—finding value before the market caught on.

🌀 What is Quantitative Easing? -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llslyXPu6wI


🧨 ORDER OF MARKET TREND
✅ 1. Interest Rates
✅ 2. Amount of Buyers/Consumers and Sellers/Producers
✅ 3. Price Action
✅ 4. Therefore; Increase in interest rates increases Sellers in the market, making price to fall
                 Decrease in interest rates increases Buyers in the market, making price to rise
✅ 5. Hence; Relationship between Demand and Supply
```

```
🧨 When the economy is doing good, inflation increases, Central bank increases interest rates.
🧨 When the economy is doing bad, inflation decreases, Central bank decreases interest rates.

## Bond Calculation

```
Bond Yield: It is measure return of a bond(%)

Bond Yield =  Bond Coupon    * 100 %
             -------------
              Bond Price

 PRICE          | COUPON             | YIELD (%)
----------------------------------------------------------
 $ 1000         | $ 50               | 5 %
 $ 900          | $ 50               | 5.5 %    
 $ 1100         | $ 50               | 4.5 % 

✅✅✅ Therefore; Increase in Interest Rates increases Sellers in the market, making Price to fall. Hence leading to increase in Yield.
                  Decrease in Interest Rates increases Buyers in the market, making Price to rise. Hence leading to decrease in Yield.

## Compounding Calculation

```
👉👉👉 COMPOUNDING CALCULATOR ===> https://github.com/devopsengineerDan/compound-interest-calculator

👉👉👉 COMPOUNDING FORMULAE 
👉 Yearly Contribution Compounding
FV = PV (1 + R/F)^NF
Future Value = Present Value (1 + Rate/Frequency of compounding)^Number of years * Frequency of compounding
🧨 Frequency of compounding = Is Daily
Future Value = 500,000(1+0.12/365)^10*365
Future Value = 1,659,731

👉 Monthly Contribution Compounding
FV = A((1+r)^n -1)/r
A = 3,000
r = 12% which is 0.12 for one month is 1% which is 0.01
n = 10 yrs * 12 mths = 120 mths
Future Value = 3000((1+0.01)^120-1)/0.01
Future Value = 1,150,193

👉 Total
Total Future Value =  1,659,731 + 1,150,193
Total Future Value =  2.8 million

 NEWS ANALYSIS


💡 **Notion Tip:** Create a new page and select `Daily entry` ****from the list of template options to automatically generate the format below every day



✅ ✅ ✅ NFP (non Farm Payroll)- non farm professionals ✅ ✅ ✅

-we avoid trading a day prior it because there is a cloud in price that prevents clarity in price and demanding that high level of degree of clarity would be a mayhem

-in NFP price tends to attack the nearest liquidity pool and if prior the release of the news there was that Orderflow in price nfp may tend to break that monotony not all the times but most of the times 

-and here price respects HTF PD arrays not with the highest degree of precision but price may overshoot it with some few handles 



✅ ✅ ✅ FOMC & FEDERAL FUND RATE ✅ ✅ ✅

-It is normally released at 2pm ET 

-if there are no news in the morning session its advisable to avoid trading the morning session prior fomc but if there is some clarity in price you can execute on the trade and be out of the market place before 10:30 go for the low hanging fruit objective

-in this price respects HTF OF  with that high degree of precision and our main target is the low hanging fruit objective dont be overzealous 

-when feds are speaking price does not reprice as a result of price reacting to what they have said but their words are just utilized  as a smoke screen to make price vulgar by the market makers

-we trade at the last hour macro because price may trade softer


✅ ✅ ✅ CPI NUMBER ✅ ✅ ✅

This is a straight bullet where liquidity is purged..it necessarily does not have to be that macro other macros can also be incorporated of the other news.. this is just what is normally anticipated for price to do.. its not the beyond end all panacea

# ICT STRATEGY

```
> LOT SIZE ---> CONTRACT SIZE

> PD-ARRAY ---> Price level in which price react to Bullish or Bearish

> OPEN INTEREST ---> Total number of Future Contracts HELD/OPEN by market participants at the end of a day

> SLIPPAGE ---> During FUNDAMENTALS Affects Take Profit and Stop Loss






> RANGE / CONSOLIDATION / CHOPPY

> MOMENTUM / DISPLACEMENT Candlestick

> IMPULSIVE / EXPANSION 

> RETRACEMENT

> REVERSAL / MARKET SHIFT

> 1. MARKET STRUCTURE / OVERALL MARKET TREND [HIGHS && LOWS]

> 2. DEMAND && SUPPLY

> 3. IMPULSIVE PRICE SWING HIGH && SWING LOW

> 4. RESISTANCE(CONSISTENT SWING HIGHS) && SUPPORT (CONSISTENT SWING LOWS)

> 5. ORDER BLOCKS

> FAKE-OUTS





> FAIR VALUE GAP

> VOLUME IMBALANCE

> GAP







> LIQUIDITY POOL / LIQUIDITY SWEEP

> LIQUIDITY VOID

> LIQUIDITY RUN

> STOP RUN

> HIGH RESISTANCE LIQUIDITY RUN => 79% and Higher Fibonnacci

> LOW RESISTANCE LIQUIDITY RUN => 50% and Lower Fibonnacci







> PRICE EQUILIBRIUM / FIBONACCI / FAIR VALUATION

> EQUILIBRIUM PRICE vs DISCOUNT PRICE(BUYERS) / EQUILIBRIUM PRICE vs PREMIUM PRICE(SELLERS)

> AIM for (79% - Reversal)

> PRICE DELIVERY ===> Expansion  ->  Retracement  ->  Reversal  ->  Consolidation  ->  Expansion  ->  REPEAT

> PRICE DELIVERY ===> Accumulation  ->  Manipulation  ->  Distribution



> Sell side Imbalance Buy side Inefficiency (SIBI)?. In ICT concepts, SIBI is a type of fair value gap. It is a Bearish Fair value Gap.
> Buy side Imbalance Sell side Inefficiency (BISI)?. In ICT concepts, BISI is a type of fair value gap. It is a Bullish Fair value Gap.



> Reversal ===> RETRACEMENT [WITH BOTH BULLISH AND BEARISH]
> Pivot/ Institutional Funded Candlestick (IFC) ===> SHARP RETRACEMENT WITH DISPLACEMENT CANDLESTICK



> More information from price is needed hence I remain neutral.
> With price @3395 as draw on liquidity e.g bsl/ssl
> IFVG and underlying encroachment act as support/resistance 
> Resistance Liquidity run on a bullish trend && > Support Liquidity run on a bearish trend

> CE ---> Consequent Encroachment refers to the 50% level of an ICT Fair Value Gap (FVG). In realm of ICT trading, 50% level is considered as the most important level for buying and selling of an asset. An FVG is an imbalance (a gap) between 
  wicks of consecutive candles.

> STB Zone ---> Sell To Buy ---> Support
> BTS Zone---> Buy To Sell ---> Resistance

> S/R Flips ---> Firstly S/R stands for Support/Resistance, the idea behind the flip is that this method of setup is confirmed when price reclaims a level that was previously lost, then uses that now taken level as new support or resistance.

> EQ ---> As mentioned EQ stands for Equilibrium, this is the middle point were supply and demand are equal, this is normally easy to spot when the price is trading in a range, as the EQ level will simply be the middle of that range.
