GIT COLLABORATION Link http://adzumi.co.ke/blog/github_contribution

As a new developer, contributing to a project can be scary. I get it,  I was there too. It took me way too long to make my first Pull Request.

Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions.

STEP 1: SET UP A WORKING COPY ON YOUR COMPUTER
First of all, you need a local fork of the project, so go ahead and press the “fork” button on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account and you’ll see a note that it’s been forked underneath the project name:



Now you need a copy locally, so find the clone URL in the right-hand column and use that to clone locally using a terminal:

$ git clone https://github.com/lawrence254/StudentEngagement.git
Which will do something like this:



Now navigate to the project's directory:

$ cd StudentEngagement
Finally, in this stage, you need to set up a new remote that points to the original project so that you can grab any changes and bring them into your local copy. Firstly click on the link to the original repository, it’s labeled “Forked from” at the top of the GitHub page. This takes you back to the projects main GitHub page, so you can find the Clone URL and use it to create the new remote, which we’ll call upstream.

$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/lawrence254/StudentEngagement.git
You now have two remotes for this project on disk:

origin which points to your GitHub fork of the project. You can read and write to this remote.
upstream which points to the main project’s GitHub repository. You can only read from this remote.
STEP 2: MAKE SOME CHANGES
This is the fun bit where you get to contribute to the project. The number one rule is to put each piece of work on its own branch. If the project is using git-flow, then it will have both a master and a development branch. The general rule is that if you are adding a new feature then branch from development. If the project only has a master branch, the branch from that. 

For this example, the forked repository had a number of branches already, one of them called 'lawrence'. This is the branch the owner of the repository has been working on. We’ll assume we’re adding a feature in StudentEngagement, so we branch to that branch:

$ git checkout lawrence
$ git pull upstream lawrence && git push origin lawrence
Firstly we ensure we’re on the master branch. Then the git pull command will sync our local copy with the upstream project and the git push syncs it to our forked GitHub project. Finally, we checkout to the 'lawrence' branch. 

Now you can add a feature(Or fix a bug).

If the project has tests, run them to ensure you haven’t broken anything. You may also add a new test to show that your change fixes the original problem.

STEP 3: CREATE A PULL REQUEST
To create a Pull Request you need to push your branch to the origin remote and then press some buttons on GitHub.

To push the new branch:

$ git push origin lawrence
Now swap back to the browser and navigate to your fork of the project (https://github.com/YomZsamora/StudentEngagement in my case) and you’ll see that the branch is listed at the top with a handy “Compare & pull request” button:



Go ahead and press the button! 

On this page, ensure that the “base fork” points to the correct repository and branch. Then ensure that you provide a good, succinct title for your pull request and explain why you have created it in the description box. Add any relevant issue numbers if you have them.



If you scroll down a bit, you’ll see a diff of your changes. Double check that it contains what you expect.

Once you are happy, press the “Create pull request” button and you’re done.

For your work to be integrated into the project, the maintainers will review your work and either request changes or merge it.

To Summarize
That’s all there is to it. The fundamentals are:

Fork the project & clone locally.
Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy.
Ensure you're working on the correct branch.
Do the work, write good commit messages and read the CONTRIBUTING file if there is one.
Push to your origin repository.
Create a new Pull Request in GitHub.

from django.views.generic import TemplateView

  url(r'^sw.js', (TemplateView.as_view(template_name="sw.js", content_type='application/javascript', )), name='sw.js'),
]


DJANGO && MONGODB CONNECTION

1)django_mongodb_engine
2)djongo -> transpiler you write sql queries and it transpiles to mongo nosql queries

1)django_mongodb_engine ->check https://django-mongodb-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/setup.html
Django-nonrel, a fork of Django that adds support for non-relational databases
Djangotoolbox, a bunch of utilities for non-relational Django applications and backends
Django-nonrel
pip install git+https://github.com/django-nonrel/django@nonrel-1.5
Djangotoolbox
pip install git+https://github.com/django-nonrel/djangotoolbox
Django MongoDB Engine
You should use the latest Git revision.

pip install git+https://github.com/django-nonrel/mongodb-engine
Configuration
Database setup is easy (see also the Django database setup docs):

DATABASES = {
   'default' : {
      'ENGINE' : 'django_mongodb_engine',
      'NAME' : 'my_database'
   }
}
Django MongoDB Engine also takes into account the HOST, PORT, USER, PASSWORD and OPTIONS settings.

Possible values of OPTIONS are described in the settings reference.



2)djongo ->check https://pypi.org/project/djongo/
Install djongo:

pip install djongo
Into settings.py file of your project, add:

DATABASES = {
     'default': {
         'ENGINE': 'djongo',
         'NAME': 'your-db-name',
     }
 }
Run (ONLY the first time to create collections in mongoDB):

manage.py makemigrations
manage.py migrate
YOUR ARE SET! HAVE FUN!

Requirements
Djongo requires python 3.6 or above.
How it works
Djongo is a SQL to mongodb query transpiler. It translates a SQL query string into a mongoDB query document. As a result, all Django features, models etc work as is.

Django contrib modules:

'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.sessions',
and others… fully supported.

WINDOWS FIX FORPOSTGRES CONFIGURATION 

By default the PostgreSQL server will listen only on a local loop-back interface 127.0.0.1. If you need to configure your PostreSQL server to listen on all networks you will need to configure its main configuration file /etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf:
$ sudo nano /etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf
and add the following line somewhere to the CONNECTIONS AND AUTHENTICATION section:
listen_addresses = '*'

sudo service postgresql restart
sudo ufw allow from any to any port 5432 proto tcp

UNINSTALL POSTGRESQL -> sudo apt-get --purge remove postgresql postgresql  postgresql-client  postgresql-client postgresql-client-common postgresql-common  postgresql-contrib postgresql-contrib

REMOVE OLD UBUNTUUPDATEFILES FROM /boot

sudo apt-get-clean

First, get the name of the kernel the system is currently running by using uname like this:

uname -r
Make a note of that because that is the name of the current active kernel you don’t want to remove. Now knowing that, we need to figure out what the other—extraneous—kernels are:

dpkg --list | grep linux-image
Depending on how many updates have been installed on your system this could be a long list or a short list but it should have at least one extraneous kernel install in there.

Once you see that list, make note of the extraneous kernels and then run this command:

sudo apt-get purge linux-image-x.x.x.1-generic

Or if you use aptitude use this variant of the command:

sudo aptitude purge linux-image-x.x.x.1-generic
