# Information Security Objectives

The general objective of this proposal is to create a standard set of high-level information security rules for all institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union to ensure an enhanced and consistent degree of protection against the evolving threats to their information.

The general objective is translated into four specific objectives:

 - Establish harmonised and comprehensive categories of information based on the level of confidentiality;
 - Identify security gaps and implement measures required;
 - Establish an efficient forum for cooperation on information security between the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union;
 - Modernise the information security policies, taking account of current trends such as digital transformation and remote working.
