# TECHNICAL SPHERE

## Information Security Objectives

The general objective of this proposal is to create a standard set of high-level information security rules for all institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union to ensure an enhanced and consistent degree of protection against the evolving threats to their information.

The general objective is translated into four specific objectives:

 - Establish harmonised and comprehensive categories of information based on the level of confidentiality;
 - Identify security gaps and implement measures required;
 - Establish an efficient forum for cooperation on information security between the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union;
 - Modernise the information security policies, taking account of current trends such as digital transformation and remote working.

# ORGANIZATIONAL SPHERE

```
- Organizational sphere ðŸš€ WHY -> ðŸš€ DISTRIBUTED BACKUPS READY FOR ANY NEGATIVE INEVENTUALITY/OUTCOME/AFTERMATH
                        ðŸš€ HOW -> IDENTIFY -> PROTECT -> DETECT -> RESPOND -> RECOVER
                        ðŸš€ WHAT -> CIA Triad - (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
                        -> SOC - (Security Operation Centre)
                           *Prevention, Detection, Response*
                        -> XDR - (Extended Detection Response)
                        -> SOAR - (Security Orchestration Automation Response system)
                           SOAR = SOC + XDR

1*GOVERNANCE - POLICY/LAW
2*CRYPTOGRAPHY         ===> 2FA, USB Authentication, Cookie/Cache Session Authentication
3*NETWORK SECURITY     ===> Firewall, VPN, Endpoints Configurations, Proxy and Reverse Proxy(Orchestration+Load Balancer)[Nginx, Apache2]
4*[AUTHENTICTATION, IDENTITY and ACCESS MANAGEMENT] SECURITY ===> Controls for Admin + Manager + User Accounts
-----------------------------------------------
Active Directory(Using LDAP Protocol)
- USB Signing
- MFA(Face, Fingerprint)
- 2FA
- Passwordless
- SSO(Single Sign On)

PAY ATTENTION TO: Location, Request Type & Amount, Frequency
Types of Administrators
Root
System
Database
Network
All these Administrators must sign in to a PAM(Privileged Access Management)System 
-----------------------------------------------

5*APPLICATION SECURITY ====> Penetration Vulnerability Testing/DEVSECOPS
                       ====> Secure Coding Best Practices, Use Standard(Frameworks,Libraries,Packages,Modules), Unit testing(Remove bugs|Work as expected)
6*DATA SECURITY        ====> Database Encryption
ðŸš€ DATA BACKUPS

7*PERSONNEL TRAINING

8*ENDPOINT MANAGEMENT
