Sublist3r by Ahmed Aboul-Ela is arguably the simplest subdomain scraping tool that comes to mind. This light-weight Python script gathers subdomains from numerous search engines, SSL certificates, and websites such as DNS Dumpster. The set-up process on my personal machine was as straightforward as:
$ git clone https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r.git
$ cd Sublist3r
$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```
